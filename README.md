Hey, this is a program that I worked on by myself using Objected Oriented Programming in C++. It tells a user about how much carbon dioxide their car produced based on two inputs - the type of fuel their car consumed (i.e gasoline or diesel) and the amount of fuel their car consumed in their last trip. Based on the C02 value that comes through these inputs, if it is larger than 50kg, the user will receive instructions or steps on how to be more eco-firendly. Ultimately, the goal of this project was to reduce the amount of carbon emissions that are released through automobiles by informing the users about their impact on the environment.
